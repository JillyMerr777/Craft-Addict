# Craft Addict — basic demo

Simple static demo with a mid-century / 70s inspired aesthetic. Files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — client interactions (parallax, wizard, inspiration)

Place your `favicon.png` and `logo.png` inside an `assets/` folder at the project root.

To open: just open `index.html` in a browser (no server required for basic functionality).
